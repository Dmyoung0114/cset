2. Abstractions is programming a function, hiding it away, and calling it with a shorter simpler term to save time. Higher levels of programming have more abstractions so they can focus on doing other things. lower level programming languages have less abstractons and are more time consuming to work with

# Pros
 IM sure you can create multiple shortcuts and acclerate the time you need to finish a program

in case of error it will still be able to run the program and possibly get the job done

designed to be easy for a casual audience.

# Cons
even though its easy for beginners other programming languages wont allow you to do this and you might get stuck in old patterns from javascript

it could also confuse beginners because they dont know that you have to be specific because javascript automatically does it for them they might not even be aware of the feature

I imagine for for advanced programmers there still has to be some short of shortcoming but i dont know what it is.
