Personally my biggest challenge is debugging and trying to find errors and where the code went wrong, but  with this comes alot of frustration for me sometimes because
im determined to find out whats going wrong with my code on my own. I find i need to take breaks alot and space out my work but i wish i was able to just go straight through everything.

do while loops will execute a statment adn tehn checks the conditions, for loop will check if the conditions are correct and then it will execute the statement. 
 A while loop will keep executing a statement as long as the conditions are true.

It really helps lay down the foundation of what you will need to program its like writing a rough draft. once you finish you can write the code and if you experience any problems you can use those notes and find out where it couldve gone wrong at. Also others looking at your code can easily follow through with your thought process so if you need help and something reviewed its easier for them to break down your code.
