## 1.

i would say about a 7 and i only say this because some of my friends seem to be having the same amount or more trouble than me. 
And i do want to communicate with my group more they seem to provide good solutions and just having multiple different codes to look at can help if i just cant get something.
Im very shy so ive been calling some of my friends in the class 
 and this has been helping me but they can only sometimes help me find a solution as opposed to me group.



## 2.
arrays = [0,1,2,3,4,...]
arrays is a list of values  and al lthe values get stored into one varible, arrays.

objects = {Make: "Ford" Model: "escape" Year: 2003};
with objects you can have multiple varibles with their own values that describe them




## 3.
i had many ideas but i didnt know how to execute them in a timely manner, but having objects really couldve helped with weapons,
player inventory,and player characteristics like health stamina mana etc.
