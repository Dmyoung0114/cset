if corrupt companies owned html they might be on our side now but have the power to change the rules of the internet later on down the line they could have the power to control whether or not the internet is behind a paywall  or have the power to block, censor citizens based on whatever speech they do and do not agree with, censor news or protest and completely control a narrative. There are so many capabilities one could do if they owned html. It would be very bad if a private company had the power to control something everyone uses and practically needs to get through everyday life now. The html should be open standard to protect everyoneâ€™s freedom of speech and accessibility to the internet it should be a free open source of information.

if you have the syntax wrong like Yoda did, we as English speakers were still able to understand the basic meaning of what he was trying to say even though its backwards. With Noah Chomsky his semantics were completely wrong, and the sentence made no sense, we as English speakers were not able to understand the meaning he was trying to convey. Just like in html if you get the syntax wrong like Yoda, html will attempt to run and still get the basic understanding and get the job done. With semantics in html if you make an bad sentence like Noah Chomsky did and type in html that does not make any sense, the browser will not be able to understand it and it will not properly convey the html you are trying to get it to run.
