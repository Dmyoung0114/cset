My favorite CSS property has to be the background-color, not for any specific reason other than i used it alot. The property values of background-color are color, transparent, initial and inherit. you can use it to change the color of the entire page or an element. Opacity is the transparency of the background-color, the intial value  is set to 100% so the background-color is not transparent.

 you could easily style the color for spicy using class tags like
 <li class="spicy">Hot wings</li>
 and then use 
 .spicy{
 color: red;
 } you could use the classes to change any type of spicy, vegetarian or glutten free foods design.
 and you could also use ids like <li id=#spicy> </li>would help then you can specifically label spicy and vegeterian and glutten free food with the id you could use the IDs to skip to vegetarian glutten free or spicy foods.

Inheritance is the child element getting the same style to it and the parent element. If you have a parent element  and set the color to orange and then tell the child to inherit from the parent then the child will inherit the same properties as the parents and the color would be orange.
The difference between cascade, and specificity is cascade applies styles to an element based on what rules are applied. Specificity is when there are two rules that go to the same element and then the browser picks the one that is more specific than the other. Cascade is used to work with the browser and is used to link to your html so you can change how the elements in your html looks in your browser.  You can use specificity to only use one CSS rule to point to an element in CSS.
