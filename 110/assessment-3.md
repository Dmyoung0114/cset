One way to keep up to date is to frequently check the mdn to find new updated methods as well as old outdated methods, as well as keeping up to date with new industry tricks. Also checking w3 and keeping up to date with new and pending drafts on https://drafts.csswg.org/. Frequently checking and reading these sites will keep me up to date with the constantly changing internet.

One big limitations of floating is that it was originally intended for the us of website design layout. floating is a technique used to do something it was not originally intended for. Floating objects messes up vertical height measurements and causes the rest of the elements to move up and surround the floated object. But when you have different browsers most if not all of the items are misplaced This especially happens when you have browsers with different width and height dimensions. It throws everything off and nothing will look as intended unless you have the exact same screen dimensions that the layout was created on.

flex direction affects main axis and works with items horizontally across the screen. flex direction has pretty self explanatory values like row(puts items in to a row), row reverse(puts items in to a reverse row), column(puts items in to columns), and column reverse(puts items in to reverse columns). The main axis will be based on whatever is chosen.
the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis based off of what was chosen. properties like align items, align self, align content, and justify content all work on the cross axis to determine the alignment on the cross axis.
if flex direction: row reverse; and justify content: flex start; those items will now be aligned on the right side the main axis is flipped backwards and it reflects that with cross axis values.
