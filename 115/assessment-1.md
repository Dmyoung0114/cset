Now that you've spent a few weeks working on longer projects, how do you think you'll adapt to working in the professional world?

 I would be rushing to be on top of a project as soon as i get it. So that way i can get the simple stuff out of the way right at the beginning and work my way into tougher stuff. Pacing will be a huge factor that i need to work on instead of cramming it all in one sitting and getting frustrated. Especially in a work scenario where the things i do matter, the time that i waste is not mine, and my job is potentially on the line.

Imagine you are building your Choose-Your-Own-Adventure project in JavaScript for the browser. The user has clicked a button to select which room to enter, walk through how you would manipulate the page to show the next room's description. Explain the DOM methods you would use and why.

lets say the rooms are a class. you could let Map = getElementsbyClassName("rooms") (let index of Map) and grab each of the rooms
and have it console log the room and its description.

Why are different data structures useful? Use the Document Object Model as an example. Would it work as any structure other than a tree?

having multiple data structures are useful because you can use them differently as needed for the algorithm and function that you are trying to achieve the document Object Model is set in a tree structure because it has a branching structure. Tree structures are used mostly for sorted data sets because trees are much more easily manipulated than linear data structures like an array or list. In the tree structure elements and tags can have parent or child nodes and you can insert change or remove items without being extremely specific to code that may change later on down the road. I do not think that having any other structure would work and if it did it would be very tedious to work with, and you would probably have to be very specific about inserting removing and changing content
